# <My Portfolio Site>

## Description

    For this project, I wanted to present all the skills that I have learned within my first week of programming. Through this portfolio,  I was able to deepen my knowledge of HTML. The porfolio also doubly served as a way to flex my creative juices. While doing this project, I learned how to build robust HTML layout while simultaenously learning how to independently style each element. 

    This project will serve as my portfolio, so I want to be able to include information about myself, my work, and how to get in contact with me. Additionally, I want ensure that I am including mindful styling that will make my portfolio that is able to show of my skills to anyone who might be viewing this.
